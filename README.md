Combined Compact Difference Scheme 

Proposed by:

(1) "A Family of High Order Finite Difference Schemes with Good Spectral Resolution", Krishnan Mahesh, JCP 1998

(2) "A Three-Point Combined Compact Difference Scheme", Peter C.Chu and Chenwu Fan, JCP 1998

Matrix from:

(1) Page 6154, "Further improvement and analysis of CCD scheme: Dissipation discretization and de-aliasing properties",
T.K.Sengupta, V.V.S.N.Vijay, S.Bhaumik, JCP 2009

Inverts the Matrix and finds x (of Ax=B) using Gauss Elimintaion (Code from Rosetta: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination#Fortran)

Thanks to Dr.Sainath Chamarthi for the guidance!

Thanks to Prof.Tapan Sengupta and Dr.Aditi Sengupta for sending the references and for helping with the matrix.
